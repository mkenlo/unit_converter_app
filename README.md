# Unit Converter App

This is my first Flutter application. It was build following the Udacity Course on flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Build Native Mobile Apps with Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/udacity-course)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
